# todolist
Lab task for CMP5332 Object-Oriented Programming, week 7.

This GitHub repo contains the following three Java source code files:

* `TodoList.java` (stub class)
* `TodoListItemTest.java` (JUnit test class)
* `TodoListTest.java` (JUnit test class)

To begin this task, you will need to use your GitHub user account to **fork** this repo.
This creates your own copy of the repo on GitHub.
Once you have done this, you can **import** the project into Eclipse (or another IDE of your choice).
